👋 Hey there, I'm Christine, and I'm thrilled to share my journey, one defined by resilience, adaptability, and an unwavering pursuit of excellence. My diverse experiences have shaped me into a professional with a unique blend of skills and determination.

🎓 My journey began with a strong academic foundation, where I distinguished myself as one of the top graduates of my high school. This early experience instilled in me the value of hard work and perseverance in the face of adversity, and it became the cornerstone of my future endeavors.

🌍 This foundation led me to a career in the military, where I was selected for the prestigious Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center program. The rigorous training and discipline I received not only honed my language skills but also reinforced my resilience and my unwavering commitment to excellence.

💼 Transitioning to civilian life, I embraced the challenge of self-study to earn my 'Enrolled Agent' certification, a prestigious recognition of my expertise in tax law and my ability to represent clients in tax court. This achievement speaks to my self-discipline and dedication to mastering complex subjects.

📬 My journey continued with a dual role as a tax preparer and a post office delivery person, a period that exemplified my strong work ethic and my ability to manage multiple responsibilities with efficiency and dedication.

💻 Most recently, I ventured into the tech world, completing a high-intensity full-stack program with distinction. I successfully passed every assessment, a rare achievement in my graduating class.

🚀 My story is one of continuous growth, driven by a passion for learning and resilience forged through diverse life experiences. Whether in the military, the field of accounting, or the tech industry, I bring a unique blend of discipline, adaptability, and expertise.

💪 In the workplace, I'm known for my dedication, attention to detail, and effective communication abilities. These non-technical skills, combined with my technical expertise, allow me to excel in a variety of roles and industries.

🎨 When I'm not immersed in the professional world, I have a passion for crocheting amigurumi and exploring my artistic side through watercolor painting.

🌐 I'm excited to apply my unique qualities and experiences to the web development world, where I can continue to grow, contribute, and excel. Let's connect and explore the possibilities together!
